In a real cult, nobody is allowed to "suggest changes", as you're expected to obey the authority. However, since I'm a regular human (not created "in God's image"), I'm not omniscient, so I kindly ask you to post suggestions.

You can open issues if you're unsure. Open PRs if you're confident enough
