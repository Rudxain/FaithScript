A lang based on [PHP](https://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design), [JS](https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs), and Holy C. Meant as a parody/satire of religious/cult mindsets and dogmas (including ideologies).

I've chosen those langs, because:
> JS & PHP are jokes that everyone decided to take seriously - (unknown)

Which is reminiscent of most religions. And Holy C is a C-family language with devotion included.

## Features

- GOP (God Oriented Programming), which is just regular OOP, but the root super-class is an `Object` named `God`. All subclasses and objects are constructed from `God`. Attempting to `God(God)` is both a `SyntaxError` and a `TypeError`, as `God` is an atheist and doesn't have the power to create another deity (despite being omnipotent).
- Of all numbers, `3` is considered falsy, for no reason whatsoever.
- `69` is considered "sinful", any use of it will incur in a slowdown penalty of 69%.
- `666` is a `SyntaxError`, use `665+1` instead.
- The only `Bool` is `true`. In a dogmatic mindset, there's no such thing as "false". You must blindly believe everything the cult says.
- String literals can be written using any combination of `"` and `'`. `''` is considered "the same" as `"`
- Monkey Patching, reflection/introspection, and operator overloading, are all forbidden. You're not the authority here, you're an **intellectual slave**
- `gaslight` operator allows you to cast values to absolutely any type (including custom objects). But it's very unreliable, as some objects aren't gullible enough
